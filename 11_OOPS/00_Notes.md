# Javascript and classes

Remember, Javascript have classes. This feature was introduced with the ECMAScript 2015 specification(often referred as ES6). However, it's important to note that JavaScript is primarily a prototype-based language, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. In other words, it provides a more familiar syntax for the developers coming from class-based languages such as Java or C++, but under the hood it works somewhat differently

Remember it's only just a programming paradigm
