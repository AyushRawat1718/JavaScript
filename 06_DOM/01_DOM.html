    /*
    Nodes can be of three types
    >Element Nodes: These are the HTML elements you see on a web page, like <div>, <p>, or specific buttons and forms.
    >Comment Nodes: These are comments included in the HTML code for programmers' reference, but they are not displayed on the web page
    >Text Nodes: Whenever there is a text then it would be count as a text nodes, otherwise all the whitespace character(spaces, tabs, newline) will be count as a Text Nodes (before and after the Element Node). These characters are essential for formatting and layout but are invisible on the page themselves.
